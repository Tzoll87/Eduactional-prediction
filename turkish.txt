This python notebook contains the turkish student evaluation form in which from multiple classes, students have evaluated their teachers and their courses. In the dataset, you can find multiple informations about the students school activity and status, after which there are a lots of questions about the teachers style and valuation, and the course's valuation. In the prediction modell, as you will see, I've melted the valuation for these questions, based on the mentioned two groups. After that, I've built a basic clustering modell, to create groups from the students given.
